Scala Information Retrieval project:

The idea here was to implement a basic vector space model for an Information Management course i took in College
that would perform the various operations on a search term:

1. stop-word removal
2. stemming
3. rank documents on their relatedness to the search term
4. give an additional score to documents that, alone, contained a high level of term similarity
5. return a document ranking for the search term in order of relatedness

main focus was given to ranking term similarity within a lone document.
